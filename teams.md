## Team Building Tips

### Must-Have Roles
1. **AoE Damage** - At least 2 Pokemon with AoE moves (for catching grouped enemies)
2. **Dragon Answer** - Fairy-type or Ice coverage
3. **Speed Variety** - Mix of fast (snipe) and bulky (sustain)

### Avoid
- 3 Pokemon with same 4x weakness
- All Physical attackers (too risky)
- All Huge Pokemon (easy targets)
- No AoE moves (can't compete)

### Item Priority
1. **Blue Orb/Red Orb** - If using Kyogre/Groudon
2. **Life Orb** - Best for damage dealers
3. **Yache/Shuca Berry** - For 4x weak Pokemon
4. **Assault Vest** - For bulky special attackers
5. **Focus Sash** - For glass cannons

## Counter Picks

| If opponent has... | Counter with... |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Water spam | Grass coverage, Electric types |
| Dragon spam | Sylveon, Xerneas, any Fairy |
| Ground spam | Flying types (immune to EQ) |
| Kyogre | Grass coverage, Rindo Berry |
| Groudon | Water AoE (Kyogre hard counters) |
| Rayquaza | Fairy types (Delta Stream doesn't help vs Fairy) |

**Note**: Abilities like Water Absorb, Levitate do NOT work in this game (except Rayquaza's Delta Stream from item/innate).
